# 5-second rule - Mel Robbins

Mel saw a rocket lauching: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Fire and smoke and the shuttle lauched. She thought: "That's it! I'll launch myself out of the bed tomorrow, like a rocket. I'll move myself so fast that I won't have time to talk myself out of it." That's it! The moment you have an instinct to act on a goal, you must 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and phisically move or your brain will stop you.

## Why works?

Wherever you set a goal, your brain mark that with a red flag. For example, if you set a goal to exercise more, wherever you pass by the gym, your prefrontal cortex will tell you to enter inside. That's your instinct reminds you of your goals. 

The problem with that instinct is that it can be easily overrulled by your intelectual and thinking. Your brain prefers comfort and acquired habits to changes and learning. That's why it tries to stifle your instinct wherever it appears.

## Courage

Courage: The commitment to begin without any guarantee of success.
That's it with the 5-second rule, act, with no guarantee that that action will lead some kind of reward.

## Your mind needs a break

Some times, don't force you to use the 5-seconds rule. Allow yourself to procrastinate productively as well.

## Tip

You can't control how you feel, but you can always choose how to act. Use the 5-second rule to act.
