 # 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

Covey believes the way we see the world is entirely based on our own perceptions. 
In order to change a given situation, we must change ourselves, and in order to change ourselves, we must be able to change our perceptions.

These days, people look for quick fixes. They see a successful person, team, or organization and ask, "How do you do it? Teach me your techniques!" But these "shortcuts" that we look for, hoping to save time and effort and still achieve the desired result, are simply band-aids that will yield short-term solutions. They don't address the underlying condition.

Habits 1, 2, 3: Self Mastery / Moving from dependence to independence
Habits 4, 5, 6: Developing Teamwork, Collaboration and communication skills
Habit 7: Continuous growth

## Be Proactive

Dont be the reactive person that say: "There's nothing I can do." or "That's just the way I am."

## Begin with the End in Mind

### Practice
1. Visualize in rich detail your own funeral. Who is there? What are they saying about you? About how you lived your life? About the relationships you had? What do you want them to say? Think about how your priorities would change if you only had 30 more days to live. Start living by these priorities.

2. Break down different roles in your life — whether professional, personal, or community — and list three to five goals you want to achieve for each.

3. Define what scares you. Public speaking? Critical feedback after writing a book? Write down the worst-case scenario for your biggest fear, then visualize how you'll handle this situation. Write down exactly how you'll handle it.

## Put First Things First

Quadrant II: Important, not urgent

We should always maintain a primary focus on relationships and results, and a secondary focus on time.

## Think Win-Win

## Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood

Before we can offer advice, suggest solutions, or effectively interact with another person in any way, we must seek to deeply understand them and their perspective through empathic listening.

In order to seek to understand, we must learn to listen.

Most people listen with the intent to reply, not to understand. We can't simply use one technique to understand someone. In fact, if a person senses that we're manipulating her, she will question our motives and will no longer feel safe opening up to us.

### Practice

Next time you give a presentation, root it in empathy. Begin by describing the audience's point of view in great detail. What problems are they facing? How is what you're about to say offering a solution to their problems?

## Synergize

When we become aware of someone's different perspective, we can say, "Good! You see it differently! Help me see what you see."

## Sharpen the Saw

To be effective, we must devote the time to renewing ourselves physically, spiritually, mentally, and socially.

### Physical

- Eat well
- Get sufficient rest and relaxation
- Exercise on a regular basis to build endurance, flexibility, and strength

### Spiritual

- Practice daily meditation
- Communicate with nature
- Immerse yourself in great literature or music

### Mental

- Read good literature
- Keep a journal of your thoughts, experiences, and insights
- Limit television watching to only those programs that enrich your life and mind

### Social

- Seek to deeply understand other people
- Make contributions to meaningful projects that improve the lives of others
- Maintain an Abundance Mentality, and seek to help others find success

### Practice

1. Make a list of activities that would help you renew yourself along each of the 4 dimensions. Select one activity for each dimension and list it as a goal for the coming week. At the end of the week, evaluate your performance. What led you to succeed or fail to accomplish each goal?

2. Commit to writing down a specific "sharpen the saw" activity in all four dimensions every week, to do them, and to evaluate your performance and results.
