## Pleasure and Pain use the same space in the brain. 

The same part of the brain that process pleasure, process the pain as well.

They work like a balance. When you are in a pleasure situation, the balance goes to the pleasure way, if you are in a pain situation, the balance goes to the opposite.

## The main rule

One of the main rules of that process is that it has a tendancy to stay in the level.
The brain do not want to be in the same way for a long period. Doesn't matter if pain or pleasure. 

So, The brain will work to keep the balance in the middle.

## Stress

That process of trying to keep everything in the middle, in the level occurs in almost everything in the world. Any diversion of the middle will cause stress.

Some biologist define stress as a detour.

That can be the key of the modern life. Where we have a lot of pleasure stuff to do, but in that way we will just keep the balance in one side. That will keep us in the stress.

## The opononent process 

If you insist in keep in one side of the balance. The brain will release some mechaninsms to bring you to the other side and try to get back the level, the balance.

The danger here can be the ameostasis. Where you developed a great difficult to reach the other side of the balance, to reach the homeostasis.

The richest and bigger contries in the world have the great number of suicide and depression of the world. There you have a lot of ways to keep you in just the pleasure side of the balance. When you keep yourself in just one side of the balance for a long way, you can be playing against yourself.

## How can we protect ourselves?

- Dopamine fasting

Remove everything that is a great stimulant of pleasure. Social Networks, Fast Food.
Of course you will became bad and sad for some time. Remember that the balance will go to the other side. But wait for the right period and you will be fine. Studies suggest 1 month.
