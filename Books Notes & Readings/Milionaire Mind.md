PART 1

- "It's not what we don't know that prevents us from succeeding; it's what we know that just ain't so that is our greatest obstacle."

- If you want to change the fruits, before you need to change the roots - If you want to change what is visible, before you need to change what is invisible. 
“My internal world makes my External World”

- Money is result, Rich is result, Health is result, your weight is result. 
We live in a cause and effect world.

Thoughts -> Feelings -> Actions -> Results

Conditioning -> Thoughts -> Feelings -> Actions -> Results

- When the mind needs to choose between the logical and the emotion, the emotion almost ever win.

- Talking about money, we tend to be like our fathers. One of them in particular or a combination from both.

- If you are saving money for the hard days, what will you have?

- I watch my thoughts and just feed the ones that make me strong

 
 
 
PART 2

- The first step for any change is the awareness
- Choose the positive ways of think, and left the negative ones

1 
- I create my own life
- Money is extremely important in areas where it makes results, and insignificant and areas where it doesn't have utility (What you choose? Your legs or your arms?)
- Not blame others, not justified to the others, not complaining of nothing

2
- Enter in the game to win, and don’t for “don’t lose”
- Shot in the moon, and at least you will hit the stars
- You have what you desire

3
- Contradictory messages - The law of attraction
- What prevents people from having what they want is not knowing what they want
- The desire, The choice, The commitment
- I commit to be rich

4
- The most of people think small because of the fear
- I think Big. I choose to help a lot of people.
- How can I reach 10 times more people that I am reaching now?

5
- The lucky will not cross your way if you don’t do actions
- Prepare yourself better that you can in the minor possible time. Fix on the way.
- I see the opportunities, not the obstacles. Think in a project that you wanted start and start it right now.
- Practice optimism. Annoy the pessimist people being optimistic with everything

6
- Be reliable
- Bless what you want and what the others have

7
- Everything happens for a reason, and this reason exist to help me
- Nothing has meaning except what we put in them
- Its not what you know, its who you know
8
- Every business depends on the sales
- Promote yourself with passion and enthusiasm

9
- The size of your problem is not the main question, what matter is your size
- Say to all the problems that they are small

10
- If you feel worthy, so you are. If don't, so you aren't.
- Great fortunes circulate around the world in abundance, and they have to go somewhere
- Universe, if any person has something excellent coming to them and they’re not willing to take it, send it to me! I am open and willing to receive all of your blessings. Thank you.
- Money just intensifies what I am

11
- A life based in security is a life based in fear
- I prefer be paid for my results, not for hour

12
- You can’t have everything, but you can have what you want
- How Can I have both? I can have both.
- Money is a lubricant so you glide through life, and not drag yourself
