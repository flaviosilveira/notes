# Master your emotions - Thibaut Meurisse

## Brain and happiness

Our brain’s primary job is not to make us happy, but to ensure our survival. That’s why, as a rule, it gives significantly more weight to negative events than to positive ones.

That’s why, it makes more sense to be constantly anxious and watchful of predators than to relax and enjoy your time around

To relieve our anxiety, we crave dopamine spurts

## Ego

your ego is a restless and never-satisfied go-getter. It always wants more – more fame, more recognition, more stuff. In this pursuit for more, the ego tends to confuse existence with possession, practically equating two very dissimilar verbs: “having” and “being.”

“Most of your emotions are based on your personal story and the way you perceive the world,” writes Meurisse. “However, as you replace your current story with a more empowering one – while, at the same time, letting go of your excessive attachment to things, people or ideas – you will be able to experience more positive emotions.”

## What impacts your emotion

- Sleep
- Your body
“Our bodies change our minds, our minds change our behavior, and our behavior changes our outcomes.” - Amy Cuddy
“Failing to exercise when you feel bad, is like explicitly not taking an aspirin when your head hurts.” - Michael Otto
- Thoughts 
At the end of the day, you become what you think about all day long! There’s a reason why meditation and visualizations have been around for so long – simply put, they work!
- Words
Just by using some words and phrases such as “could,” try” or “if,” you’re setting yourself up for failure. Use “I will,” “Definitely” and “without any doubt” instead. Also use positive affirmations because it has been shown that they can condition your mind to act in a certain way.
- Breathing
slow breathing reduces anxiety, rapid breathing relieves stress
- Music

## How to change your emotions

In order to alter and modify something, you must first understand how it’s made.
There are two kinds of emotions: Spontaneous (fear of a bear) and created emotions.

We can change created oemotions by simple formula.
formula: interpretation + identification + repetition = strong emotion

Interpretation: This interpretation is usually based on your ego. free from your ego. would you feel angry at someone for their political views if you stop thinking about your political beliefs as part of your ego?

Identification: The more attention you give it, the more powerful it becomes. The opposite is also true.

Repetition: Having the same emotions over and over again can lead to them becoming a part of your character. 
Hale Dwoskin’s Sedona Method: 
1) choose an emotion and give it your complete focus; 
2) now, ask yourself whether you’d want to release it, allow it, or welcome it; 
3) depending on the answer, ask yourself when should you do it – the only valid answer should be “now;” 
4) repeat the process as many times as necessary


## Final
you are not your emotions, and that they can be under your control
