# The Miracle Morning

- "Your level of success, will rarely exceed your level of personal development, because success is something you attract by the person you become" - Jim Rohn

- "Until we dedicate time each day to developing ourselves into the person we need to be to create the life we want, the success is always going to be a struggle to attain"

- "On the one hand, we all want to be happy. On the other hand, we all know the things that make us happy. But we don't do those things. Why? We are too busy trying to be happy..." - Matthew Kelly
