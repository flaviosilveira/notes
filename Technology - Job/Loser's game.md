# Software Engineering is a Loser’s Game
[Reference](https://dev.to/thawkin3/software-engineering-is-a-loser-s-game-2k20)

Simon Ramo in 1973 observed how games were won in amateur tennis versus professional tennis.
When two amateur opponents are playing, the game is often won not through the winner’s great skill but because of the loser’s mistakes.
When two professional opponents are playing, the game is won primarily due to the winner’s skill.

So, if you’re playing a loser’s game, a winning strategy is to simply try to avoid making mistakes and let your opponent beat himself.

Considering Software engineering as a Loser's game, here’s a list of possible unforced errors we commit. 

- Not understanding the problem before trying to code a solution
- Not understanding the tools or programming languages we use
- Not carefully reviewing our own code before asking for a code review
- Not manually testing our own code before asking for a code review
- Not writing unit tests
- Not following agreed-upon company standards
