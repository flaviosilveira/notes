# ACID

4 key properties that define a transaction

A - Atomicity: Either whole transaction executes or none.

C - Consistency: Database must be consistency before and after a transaction

I - Isolation: Execution of a transaction should not interfere with the execution of another transaction

D - Durability: The data must not be lost even if system fails.
