# DNS

## Types of DNS

A record: The address record. Used to map a domain name to an IPv4 address. Similarly, the AAAA record is used to map a domain name to an IPv6 address.

CNAME records: A canonical name record. Creates an alias that points to another domain or subdomain, but never an IP address.

ANAME record: Allows you to point the root of your domain to a hostname or a domain name.

TXT records: Allow the addition of limited text notes and is often used for ownership verification purposes, validation or security.

MX record: Specifies the mail server responsible for accepting the incoming and outgoing emails for a domain. Should point to a mail server name, not an IP address.
