# Algorithms
Measures to check a good Algorith: Time and space complexity.

## Time complexity
Measure of how much time is spended as a algorithm grows

## Space Complexity
Measure of how much working storage or extra storage is needed as a algorithm grows

We use Big O notation to represent those, time and complexity.

## Linear Search

```O(n)```

## Binary Search
looking isolated, Binary search, That is a logarithmic time, is more efficiently
than the linear search.

But, binary Search Has a pre requisite of have the inputs sorted.
Combining the operation of sort the input and search, linear search will be more efficiently.

## Merge Sort
Get the array and break it into subarrays, until we have an array with one element.
