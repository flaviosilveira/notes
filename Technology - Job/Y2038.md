# Year 2038 problem

Is a time computing problem that leaves some computer systems unable to represent times after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038.

Thats because a lot of C Libraries use a 4-byte format for unix timestamp and the limit of that is the number 2,147,483,647.

A library that uses a 8-byte format can solve the issue.
