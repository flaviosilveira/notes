# JavaScript

var -> Exists in all the code
let -> Just exists in the block where it was definied
const -> works exactly like let, but for constants

```
var i = "Valor Inicial de i";
for(let i=0;i<10;i++){
console.log('i inside for= '+i);
}
console.log('i outside for= '+i);
```

window.var_name -> works like a global scope
