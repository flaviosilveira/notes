# Social Matrix
[Video](https://youtu.be/RAqOMGnJ2MQ)

- 99% of what we know, come from others. We did not do the experiment, we weren't there in that time of history.

- So, our reality was told to us, by our parents, teachers, movies we watch, books we read.

- How are you sure of your reality if it was told for you?

- There is no way that an individual can be so diluted as we are, unless we are doing it all together. When we do it together, that makes it seems more real.

- If you know nothing about an event in history. How to know what source is real?. If you were createad in a envinronment where all believe that Earth is flat. When you read an article saying that earth is not flat, with evidences and all you will be skiptical about it. Thinking that is just Propaganda. If I was born in an environment where we not believe in flat Earth, I will read the same article and have another pair of eyes on it.

- If you love and follow a celebrity, for whatever reason, that became your reality. If I hate that same celebrity for whatever reason, that creates my reality. That draws diferent realities.

- We are created for not question anything based on incentives. We have grades, awards, our parents want us to go well in school, otherwise we wont get what we want. And how to go well in school? Memorizing the shit that school tells you. And you will follow it, because you need to go to the next level, you need your diploma, because in the future you will need a job.

- Every society has its own dinamic, a Flow of authority and reputation, status. Harvard, Nasa, you named it. If a guy with 3 phds write a book, you will believe in him more than in me.

- Google use that. If your site was linked to one of those authorities, your site will be showed first in google. When was the last time you reach page 2, 3 on google? Google build the first page, and that build your reality.

- Science. Did you already did some science? Or science is an article that someone wrote, and you take that as real. An Authority wrote that, using money from another authority and you take that as real.

- How many scientist studies have you ever validate? 5, 10? And how many scientist studies have you used to build your reality? Hundreds? Thousands? See, hundreds to thousands taked by faith and just 5 to 10 validated.
