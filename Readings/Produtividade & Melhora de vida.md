Schedule the most challenge tasks for the time that you are productive, and meetings and routine tasks for the time that you are less.

Natural ways of Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin, Endorphins
1. Dopamine: Helps us set goals and get things done. It incentivizes us to make progress and is generated at the anticipation of achieving or striving for something.
Hack: By creating a series of mini goals that you can easily achieve (and then celebrate achieving) you will help release more dopamine into your system and elevate your happiness factor.

2. Oxytocin: Also known as the cuddle hormone, it helps create strong bonds, intimacy, trust, and healthy relationships. It also lowers your cortisol levels, increases your interest in your work, and raises your cognitive abilities for problem solving and creative thinking, while boosting your immune systems, lowering your blood pressure, and increasing your libido. It can be generated through social bonding, eye contact, and attentiveness.
Hack: Go for the hug instead of the handshake! Doctors recommend giving the gift of a hug at least eight times a day. Giving small gifts to a friend or loved one will also do the trick.

3. Serotonin: Boosts your feeling of confidence, making you feel good and elevating your mood. It is generated when you’re feeling significant, important, or valued.
Hack: Sit in the sun for a brief 20 minutes while practicing gratitude for the things in your life that have value and importance to you. Your skin will absorb UV rays which produce vitamin D and releases serotonin.

4. Endorphins: Released in response to stress or pain to help reduce depression and anxiety. It acts as a sedative and anesthetic as your muscles work through hard labor.
Hack: Eat dark chocolate while laughing. Along with the scents of vanilla and lavender, dark chocolate and laughter are known to boost the release of endorphins into your system. Regular exercise is also another great way to get those endorphins flowing.
