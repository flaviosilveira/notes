D#   F   Gm  F

You’ve been running from the rain 
You hide all the hurt and pain 
Every shadow on your face 
Tells a story you can’t erase

But there’s a light beyond the fear 
If you listen, love is near

When love finds you 
It breaks the chains you held on to 
It turns the night to golden skies

It makes the lost learn how to fly 
When love finds you 
The world feels brand new

No more searching, no disguise 
Just truth behind your eyes
