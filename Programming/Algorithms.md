## Linear Search

```O(n)```

## Binary Search
looking isolated, Binary search, That is a logarithmic time, is more efficiently
than the linear search.

But, binary Search Has a pre requisite of have the inputs sorted.
Combining the operation of sort the input and search, linear search will be more efficiently.

```O(log n) ```
