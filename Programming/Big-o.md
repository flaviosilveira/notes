# Big O Notation

A way to show time it takes to run your function and relation with the size of the input.

## Time complexity

- Linear Time
The size to complete a function increases linear to the size of the input

```O(n)```

- Contant Time
The time it takes to complete a function, will not increase at all as the size of the input increases.

```O(1)```

- Quadratic Time
The time it takes to complete a function increases quadratic.

```O(n&&sup2;)```

- Cubic time
