# Big O Notation
A way to show time it takes to run your function and relation with the size of the input.

O - Comes from Order of magnitude of complexity.

## Time complexity

### Linear Time
The size to complete a function increases linear to the size of the input

```O(n)```

### Contant Time
The time it takes to complete a function, will not increase at all as the size of the input increases.

```O(1)```

### Logarithmic time

```O(log n) ```

```
Logarithm: The opposite of exponet. 
How many times I have to divide base by log, to get one?
```

### QuasiLinear

### Exponencial time

#### Quadratic Time
The time it takes to complete a function increases quadratic.

```O(n&&sup2;)```

#### Cubic time

### Factorial runtime:w


## Space complexity

### Contant Time
O(1)
