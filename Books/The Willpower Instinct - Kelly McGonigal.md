# The Willpower Instinct - Kelly McGonigal

## What is willpower?

- Many people find it easy to identify what they want, but they are not good identifying
why they fail.

### Willpower consist in three parts:
- I Won't - Resisting to something you don't want
- I Will - Avoid lazy and other things instead of doing what you need
- I Want - Remember what you want, and keeping the focus on that

## Resisting a craving

Resisting temptation have a lot more to do with your physiology, the way your body reacts.
It is not just your brain. When you see a chocolate for example, your body is capable of reduce
your blood sugar levels in order to make you eat the chocolate and get your blood sugar levels back.

### Pause and plan reaction
The body has a reaction that signifies self-control, it is called pause-and-plan.
It is not default in our body, but we can trainning to make it more available.
The way is doing breathing exercises: Try to slow down your breathing to four or six breaths per minute.
Your brain will automatically shift to stress-control mode.

## The self control muscle

- Countless studies have show that there seems to be a limited amount of willpower to go around.
- Willpower is like a muscle, that gests tired over time.
- Train it with small things

## Being good give us permission to be bad

- Not every willpower failure is caused by weakness, Sometimes we chose to give in to temptation. This is know as *moral licensing*.
- Having been good, blinds you to any potentially bad decisions you make afterwards.
- Do not think in our challenges as good or bad, train to think them like moral. Example: Cheating on your spouse is a moral flawed, why cheating on your diet is not?

## The economics of instant gratification

- Humans tend to go for irrational decisions rather than strategic when instant gratification is involved.
- Train that waiting 10 minutes before rewarding yourself. This delay make your brain act more rational.

## Final notes

- Our brain is not made to automatically resist temptation or instant gratification, you need to continuously traingg your willpower muscle with breathing exercises, awareness and mental tricks.
