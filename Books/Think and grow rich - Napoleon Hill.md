## Desire

- Fix in your mind the exactly amount of money you desire
- Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire
- Estabilish a definite date when you intend to possess the money
- Create a define plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to plan this plan into action
- Write it down
- Read twice, daily. See and fell while you read.

- Life is a checkboard, and the player opposite you is TIME. If you hesitate before moving, or neglect to move promptly your men will be wiped off the board by TIME. You are playing against a partner who will not tolerate INDECISION!
