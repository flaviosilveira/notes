## The magic of thinking big

- always smile

- use words that change the view of the scene for bigger

- always see things in a way that can be, not how they are

- be always a friend, listening, ask about the other sincerity. Learn to like people. Treat people how they were guests in your house.

- create an image from yourself ten years from now. Work, social, home.
