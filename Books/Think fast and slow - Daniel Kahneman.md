# Think fast and slow - Daniel Kahneman

## Why we struggle with statistics

When reading the statistic: “a vaccine that protects children from a fatal disease carries a 0.001% risk of permanent disability,” you will assess the risk as small. The same information can have quite the opposite effect when formulated in a different way: “One out of every 100,000 vaccinated children will be permanently disabled.”

“Low probability events are much more heavily weighted when described in terms of relative frequencies (how many) than when stated in more abstract terms of ‘chances,’ ‘risk,’ or ‘probability’ (how likely),” Kahneman points out.

## Remembering correctly

Patient A had a short procedure with a painful end, while Patient B had a longer procedure with a less painful end. Patient A and B both indicated similar pain levels when asked to rate them throughout the procedure. But once it had ended and they were asked to rate their overall pain levels, contrary to expectation, Patient A said he’d had the worst of it, even though the procedure had been much shorter.

This phenomenon is explained by the peak end rule: whatever happens last will be valued more strongly. Similarly, duration neglect means that the length of an experience does not significantly alter how we rate it.
