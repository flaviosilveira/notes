# Simple Rules - Donald Sull & M. Eisehardt

## We need simple rules

Think about a hospital where a lot of patients brought in at the same time. You are the doctor. You need to decide who to treat first. That can be easy following simple rules, such as check vital signs.

Simple rules are shortcut thinking, and they simplify the processing of information. They allow us to react quickly without having to stop and think. Effective simple rules commonly share four points:

- They are limited to a small number.
- They are unique to the person or organization using them.
- They are accurate and apply to a well-defined activity or decision.
- They provide clear guidance whilst allowing for individual judgement. 

## Kinds of simple rules

- Boundary rules - Yes / No Situations
- Prioritizing rules
- Stopping rules 
- Hot to rules
- Coordination rules (Example: japonese honeybee, Thermo Balling)
- Timing rules

## Create your own simple rules

- What will move your needle? Find your personal value by looking at what increases the gap between what energizes you and what stresses you out.

- Find the bottleneck that keeps you from creating personal value.
Which activities or decisions keep me from achieving my objectives and where will rules have the greatest impact?

- Develop simple rules that work for you.
what other people have done to achieve the same goal
