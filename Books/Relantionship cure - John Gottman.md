# The Relationship cure - John Gottman

## Bids
bid is “the fundamental unit of emotional communication.” It can come in the form of “a question, a gesture, a look, a touch.” It can also come in the form of a word, an email, the tone of your voice. It can be a gift, an invitation to a party

Three ways to respond to a bind:
- Turn Toward - Reply
- Turn Against - Arguee
- Turn Away - Ignore

## Gottman’s 5-step program to strengthening your relationships

### 1
- analyzing the way you bid and the way you respond to others’ bids

### 2
- Discover your brain’s emotional command systems

Jaak Panksepp in his book *Affective Neuroscience*, set 7 primary emotions in mammals:
1) Commander, 2) Explorer, 3) Sensualist, 4) Energy Czar, 5) Jester, 6) Sentry, 7) Nest-Builder

people differ from one another in how much they like to have these systems stimulated

To build better relationships, you should discover how your brain’s emotional command systems affect your bidding process and try to better understand the same about the people you’re close to

### 3
- Examine your emotional heritage
our past experiences with emotions
the most important aspect of your emotional heritage is your parent’s emotional families

families generally fall into “four broad categories of emotional philosophy":
1) Coaching: if you come from a family with a coaching philosophy of emotion, you probably have “a high regard for emotional expression.”
2) Dismissing: Turning away feelings. If you were raised in such a family, you’ve been taught to respond to bids for connection with silence or disregarding remarks. You minimize fears, ignore complaints and treat protests as a joke.
3) Disapproving: Turning against the feelings. If you come from an emotion-disapproving family, you may tend to frame your relationship as a power struggle.
4) Laissez-faire: No guidance. If you come from a family with a laissez-faire philosophy, you’re probably not adept at regulating your emotions very well.

It takes a brave heart to look back thoughtfully at past injuries, your family’s emotional philosophy, and your emotional history. But doing so with a clear intention of improving your current and future relationships is well worth the effort.

- Sharpen your emotional communication skills

A shrug of shoulders indicates confusion or helplessness. The crossing of arms is a signal of dissatisfaction. An open posture suggests respect and focus.

above all – just listen. Focus on being interested rather than interesting, ask questions and look for commonalities. And be present: turn off all distractions and maintain the right amount of eye contact. You can’t turn toward someone’s bids if you’re turned away by default.

### 5 
- Find shared meaning

The ability to discover shared meaning in our lives, explains Gottman, “leads to greater stability in our relationships with friends, family, and coworkers. It helps people settle conflicts and collectively pursue the goals that really matter to them

When two people find meaning, they’re willing to support each other’s dreams, even when there’s little to gain personally from doing so. All of this is very good for relationships.”

3 ways to achieve shared meanings:

- Uncovering ideals: conflicts arise from people attaching different meanings to the same situations. 
- Detecting dreams: People who encourage one another’s dreams and aspirations are happier and stay together longer than people who disregard them
- Establishing rituals: make sure to regularly engage in meaningful activities with the people you love

## 12 min Tip

Try to turn toward the emotional bids of others as often as possible and try doing it in an attentive, engaging and caring way. Consider them not just invitations to intimacy, but gifts as well. And it’s impolite to refuse a gift.
