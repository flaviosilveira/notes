# Subtle art of not giving a fuck

In Modern society people expect to be extraordinary at everything, believe they mus t be positive all the time and that they can never fail. In this book Mark Manson clears up that misconceptions.

To be truly successful in life he says you must doubt yourself, doubt others, allow negative feelings. Stop chasing fame and know that life is struggle.

## Feedback loop from hell and backwards law

### Feedback loop from hell
You are anxious, angry or worried about somthing or someone. You cnat think of anything else. You cannot be productive and your anxiety holds you back. Then you wonder why you are feeling anxious and you become anxious for being anxious. Which makes you more anxious.

### Backwards Law
Part of the problem is that we are always focusing on positive, can do attitude, we are always leading to a rejection of any negative feelings. And instead of making our lives better, that rejection makes it even worse.

To a happy and fulfilling life we have to chose to not give a fuck.

## Not Give a fuck

- Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.
- To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.

So basically, deciding to not give a fuck simply means reorienting your expectations in life by choosing what is important to you and what is not. It allows you to reclaim your life. 

## Life is a struggle

Suffering is an integral part of life.
Budhism says: "The rich suffer because of their riches, The poor suffer because of their poverty".

You cannnot be happy or succesful without struggling. So the more important question to ask is not how to be happy, but what you are willing to go throught for happiness. Chose your struglle.

Do you want to sacrifice your free time to stay at home studying? Are you going to awake from bed to chase a new job or an opportunity?

Struggle inspire growth. Success is actually measured by how many times you failed. If you really want to succeed, you will have to endure a thousand tiny failures. You can learn more from one fail than you will from a thousand successes.

## Taking charge of your life

We sometimes cannot change what happens to us, but we can change the way we think about it. In reacting to outward influences, we can take an active role in what happens to us. Often, the same event can be good or bad, depending on the metrics we use to measure it.

## Chosing the values to live by

Just like social media is constantly telling us that everyone around us is leading the perfect life, our culture has also evolved to make us strive to become extraordinary. Actually, being “average” has come to be the same as being a failure. We live in a society that believes we are all entitled to be extraordinary, without actually having to work for it. Entitlement of this kind, however, isolates us. It makes us believe we are the center of the universe and prevents us from looking at the world with curiosity and a willingness to improve ourselves.

Accept the fact that you are neither extraordinary, nor special. You are just like everyone else. But anyone who has done exceptional things in the past did them not because they believed in their own extraordinariness, but because they were striving to improve themselves.

To lead a happy life, you need to define the right values to live by.

## No One is always right

Be careful about what you believe. Even your memories can betray you. Our brains were designed to be efficient (not accurate), which means that in extreme cases, we can even conjure memories of events that didn’t happen. Accept that you may be wrong about some things in life - no one is always right!

## Facing your own mortality

You may not want to face it, but we are all going to die one day. This thought scares many people, but again, it is a question of changing your mindset. Without death, life would have no meaning. So the awareness of death can enrich our experience of life.

You are already great because you choose to control your life, despite uncontrollable factors and your own mortality. This already makes you beautiful and loved.
