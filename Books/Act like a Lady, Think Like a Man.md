# Act like a Lady, Think Like a Man

the book as a kind of “manual” to help women understand how men think in relationships

Profess (declare you as his), Provide, Protect
When a man truly loves you, he will do those three things naturally.

Introducing you as their partner, Helping and providing, Making you feel safe
If he’s not doing these things, he’s not serious.
