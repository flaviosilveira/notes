# At, On, In, By

## Transportation
### At
At, is used for a specific thing, time, location. But it have nothing to do with transportation. 

### On
On, is used for large veicles.
```
On the train
On the bus
On thre plane
```

You are sharing those large ways of transportation with other people.
If you are very rich and have your own train or plane.. you can say *In the plane*, *In the train*.

With that in mind, think about boat. A lot of people have their own boat for fishing.
So, they can use *In the boat*, otherwise if you are sharing that boat to reach an island or something like that
you say *On the boat*.

But when talk about bicycle, we use *on*. Thats because Bicycle do not have an engine or something like that
so you have to sit on the bicycle.

### In
In we use for car and taxi. You have your own car, so *In the car*. And when you are in a taxi, it is kind of your car, 
you rented it for a period of time, so it is yours. *In the taxi*.

You can put many other people in the car, but you will still use *In the car*.

### By
By, is used to talk how you got there.
```
I got here by car.
```

## Location

### At
```Meet me at my house```
At is very specific. *at my house*, not in the street, not in the city, etc...

Or in a specific addresss:
```Meet me at 657 Boulevard```
Not *In*, not *on*... It is in that specific address.

### On
Like in the trasportation, you use on for things or people that stand in the area.
```On the table```
```On the street```

### In
In, you use for surfaces also, but now you are inside, you have an obstacle between you and the thing or people you are talking about.
```He is in the house```
You will need to open a door or break a wall to see he.

### By
You use it with location to talk about something that is near or close.
```By my side```
```By my house```

## Time

### At
Remember that *at* is for specific thing. So:
```At 9 o'clock'```

### On
On is used for days
```On monday, on tuesday```
Think in a day as a surface, it has 24 hours, so *on that day*
```On my birthday, on christmass```

### In
You use In for weeks, months or years.
```In september, In 1992```
We are talking about a very long specific period of time.

### By
By is for the end, the end of the time.
```It will be done by tonight```
It is over.
