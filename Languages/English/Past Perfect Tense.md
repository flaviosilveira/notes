## Past Perfect

Used to tell stories. To talk about 2 events and when one event happen before the
other event. 

### Timeline

```I had just stepped outside when it started to rain.```

When I used past perfect, I can check which event happen before the other.

```She had just finished her exam when the timer went off```

```I couldn't go oout to dinner because I had left my wallet at home```

```He had mentioned feeling sick, but then they were surprised when he suddenly
faited```

### Formula

HAD (aux v.) + past participle (main v.)

### Doesn't matter the order

```I had just smelled smoke when the fire alarm went off```

```When the fire alarm went off, I had just smelled smoke```

### Adverb

HAD + ADVERB + PAST PARTICIPLE

```had just...had really....had already```

```He had just got in the shower when he heard a knock in the door```

```I ran to the supermarket as fast as I could, but it had already closed when I
got there```
