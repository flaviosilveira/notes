# Job Interview Prep

About 10 years ago, a little more I was a musician

But have a life in music in Brazil is not that easy.



At the time I had a student that invite Mme to work with him, I already create my websites at the time, with flash, html and css. I thought I knew a lot, but this guy teach me a lot



some time later he left the company and I thought that should be good for me also try my own path.

I became a developer in a company called IESDE. After 2 months one of the systems analysts go crazy and left the company. Since there is nobody else to do what that guy did, Here was me. I take control of the database administration and of the SVN version control. The company promoted me to analyst system.



But I thought that was to early to stop dirtying my hands with code, So I leave to work at home.

As a freelancer, remote. I got everything that comes to me. AdWords, SEO, E-commerces, WordPress Sites, and so on. One of the most cool things that I did was a code to located tractors in a parking, using GSM, Java and PHP.



After that a recruiter called me for a opportunity in the Exxon mobil, The biggest oil company in the world. They have a office here in Curitiba. So I thought that was a opportunity for me to consolidate my English. And I think that works, since then I am more confident with my English already travel some other countries and work with a lot of guys outside Brazil. Was a temporary job, So after 1 and half year I was back to work at home.



But now, I was married, and my wife was not understanding very well how is to work at home.

So I decided to looking for something and I found a developer job at a company called MalaPronta. An E-commerce where you get a room at a hotel and some stuff like that.



The history repeats again, After 2 months as a developer, I became Team leader. And as team leader we killed the entire back log and also work in the website performance taking the website to 3 seconds average.



That company close the doors, so my manager move to another one, A E-commerce again, furniture e-commerce called LojasKD, and he ask me togo with him. Since our company  was closed, we ask almost the same team to growth us. We have been working together for some time so was easy tosco the results and pass by a Black Friday with no problems.
